## Cloud network


This is a collection of Linux Scripts from my Cyber Security boot camp.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different  docker containers.

The final setup has 2 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
